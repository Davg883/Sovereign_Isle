Steephill Cove is only accessible by foot, which is why The Smugglers' Cove supper club feels like a shared secret. Lanterns hook onto chalk walls, and the evening's catch arrives across pebbles in wicker crates. Chef Mira Godwin salts and chars everything over driftwood embers while a local fiddler keeps time with the tide.

Signature plates include lobster with fennel pollen butter, ale-battered monkfish cheeks, and an elderflower posset crowned with sea buckthorn shards. Between courses, a storyteller shares legends of hidden brandy casks and the queens who turned a blind eye to keep the island fed.

**Guest Signals**
- Seating: 26 guests maximum, communal tables carved from salvaged hulls.

Arrive just before sunset. The cove erupts in gold, and the first stars appear in the rock pool reflections. Isabella recommends pairing the experience with a daytime visit to Ventnor Botanic Garden to trace how exotic plantings transformed the island climate.
